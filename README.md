## General info
The website we develop in this project is mainly used to calculate the score that the user need to achieve in every assignment based on a target overall score the user set.

## Detailed info
* This website needs user to login and register so that the user can access the full functionalities. We use **passport.js** to authenticate user and use **bcrypt** to encrypt user's password, which makes our website more securer. <br />

## Technologies
* NodeJs 14.16.X
* MongoDB Atlas
* Heroku 
* Handlebar

## Instructions of Using code
clone this repository and install all the dependencies in **package.json** and type **npm start** in terminal to run the code. However, you may not be able to run these codes because you cannot access our database. If you intend to do so, we have provide one of our username and password. And you will need to set a passport key, which could be anything you want. Please refer to here: [How to access our database](#how-to-access-our-database).

## How to access our database
We use MongoAtlas to store user information.<br />
Here is our mongoDB connection string:<br />
`mongodb+srv://Michael:1234@cluster0.30bnt.mongodb.net/WAM_Calculator?retryWrites=true&w=majority` <br />
You can download **`MongoDB compass`** and type this string to connect to our database.
Our database name is: **`WAM_Calculator`**<br />
Also, you will need to create a new file call `.env` in your local computer so that you can use our code. Please type the following code in this file:<br />
**`MONGO_USERNAME=Michael`**<br />
**`MONGO_PASSWORD=1234`**<br />
**`PASSPORT_KEY=info30005secretkey`**</br>
This PASSPORT_KEY will allow you to use passport.js while you try to run our code.
